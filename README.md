# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a client that wanted to take their driving school business online.  They wantes a website that allowed users to create their own accounts and schedule drives.  They also wanted clients to be able to pay for their classes online as well as see an online dashboard that allowed students to get access to online learning resources.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a really good job or defining the requirements for the project and identifying technical requirements.  In the design process I was able to find almost all of the requirements for the project early on.  I was also able to identify any software and hardware that we would need to obtain from a third party.

# If you could choose on part of your work on these documents to revise what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the class diagram.  I have a solid start, but I think that a lot of my classes could be broken into a couple different classes to improve readability.  I also did not include any functions in my classes, which would be added in the revision.

# How did you interpret the users needs and implement them into your design? Why is it so important to consider the users needs when designing?
When interpreting the users needs I focussed on the why primarily.  I also foccussed on the what and how, but I think the why is the most important when considering adding a new feature.  If you are really able to understand why someone wants something then you are able to deliver a prodcut that does exactly what they want because you know how they are feeling without that feature.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or startegies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software I spend a lot of time gathering requirements and background information about the system.  In the future I would spend a lot of time interviewing stakeholders as well as interviewing people who use similar software to see what they like and dont like about their software.  I would also spend a lot of time doing market research and figuring out who was the leader in that category of software to see what they are doing wrong and what they are doing right.
